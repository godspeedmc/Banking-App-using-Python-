# Banking-App-using-Python-


A basic Tkinter-based GUI with buttons and an entry are produced by this code. Banking app will feature a user-friendly interface with a buttons, entry, message box, simple dialog box. Users can create multiple accounts by providing their name, a unique account number, and an initial balance. The application ensures that each account number is unique, preventing duplication. Account holders can deposit funds into their existing accounts. The application prompts users to enter their account number and the amount they wish to deposit.

Deposited amounts contribute to the account balance. Users can withdraw funds from their accounts, provided the withdrawal amount is valid and within the account’s current balance. Like the deposit feature, users need to enter their account number and the desired withdrawal amount. The application allows users to check their account balance without performing any transactions. By entering their account number, users receive information about the account holder’s name and the current balance. The application incorporates basic error handling to address scenarios where users might provide invalid inputs or attempt transactions that exceed their account balances. Users receive appropriate warnings and messages to guide them through valid interactions.
